The Cifair is a dataset consisting of 60000 32*32 images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class the dataset is divided into five train batches and one test batch, each having 10000 images.  I trained three models on this dataset  

1-one layer neural network
2-multi layer neural network with dropout and batch normalization 
3-convolutional neural network  getting 80 percent accuracy using CNN
